// Set up attributes to hold the latest version of Redpanda and Redpanda Console.
// For GitHub, hard-code the latest version to these values:

This Docker Compose example starts three Redpanda brokers and Redpanda Console.

This Docker Compose file is also used in the https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/quick-start/[Redpanda Quickstart].

== Prerequisites

You must have https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose] installed on your host machine.

git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `docker-compose/three-brokers/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/docker-compose/three-brokers
----
endif::[]
// For the docs site, provide a download link since we have symlinked the Docker Compose file into the attachments directory of the Antora structure. See https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/attachments/

----
export REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION={latest-console-version}
----

. Run the following in the directory where you saved the Docker Compose file:
+
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

. Open Redpanda Console at http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080^].

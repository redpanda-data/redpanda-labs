This example demonstrates using Debezium to capture the changes made to Postgres in real time and stream them to Redpanda.

This ready-to-run `docker-compose` setup contains the following containers:

- `postgres` container with the `pandashop` database, containing a single table, `orders`
- `debezium` container capturing changes made to the `orders` table in real time.
- `redpanda` container to ingest change data streams produced by `debezium`

For more information about `pandashop` schema, see the `/data/postgres_bootstrap.sql` file.

== Prerequisites

You must have https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose] installed on your host machine.

== Run the lab

. Clone this repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `docker-compose/cdc/postgres-json/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/docker-compose/cdc/postgres-json
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
----

. Run the following in the directory where you saved the Docker Compose file:
+
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
+
When the `postgres` container starts, the `/data/postgres_bootstrap.sql` file creates the `pandashop` database and the `orders` table, followed by seeding the ` orders` table with a few records.

. Log into Postgres:
+
```sql
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgresuser -d pandashop
```

. Check the content inside the `orders` table:
+
```sql
select * from orders;
```
+
This is the source table.

. While Debezium is up and running, create a source connector configuration to extract change data feeds from Postgres:
+
```bash
docker compose exec debezium curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' debezium:8083/connectors --data '
{
  "name": "postgres-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
    "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
    "database.hostname": "postgres",
    "database.port": "5432",
    "database.user": "postgresuser",
    "database.password": "postgrespw",
    "database.dbname" : "pandashop",
    "database.server.name": "postgres",
    "table.include.list": "public.orders",
    "topic.prefix" : "dbz"
  }
}'
```
+
Notice the `database.*` configurations specifying the connectivity details to `postgres` container. Wait a minute or two until the connector gets deployed inside Debezium and creates the initial snapshot of change log topics in Redpanda.

. Check the list of change log topics in Redpanda:
+
```bash
docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic list
```
+
The output should contain two topics with the prefix `dbz.*` specified in the connector configuration. The topic `dbz.public.orders` holds the initial snapshot of change log events streamed from `orders` table.
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME               PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
connect-status     5           1
connect_configs    1           1
connect_offsets    25          1
dbz.public.orders  1           1
----

. Monitor for change events by consuming the `dbz.public.orders` topic:
+
```bash
docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic consume dbz.public.orders
```

. While the consumer is running, open another terminal to insert a record to the `orders` table:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgresuser -d pandashop
----

. Insert the following record:
+
```sql
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) values (5, 500);
```

This will trigger a change event in Debezium, immediately publishing it to `dbz.public.orders` Redpanda topic, causing the consumer to display a new event in the console. That proves the end to end functionality of your CDC pipeline.

== Clean up

To shut down and delete the containers along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

== Next steps

Now that you have change log events ingested into Redpanda. You process change log events to enable use cases such as:

- Database replication
- Stream processing applications
- Streaming ETL pipelines
- Update caches
- Event-driven Microservices

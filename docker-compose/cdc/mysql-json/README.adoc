This example demonstrates how to use Debezium to capture the changes made to MySQL in real time and stream them to Redpanda.

This ready-to-run Docker Compose setup contains the following containers:

- `mysql` container with the `pandashop` database, containing a single table, `orders`
- `debezium` container capturing changes made to the `orders` table in real time.
- `redpanda` container to ingest change data streams produced by `debezium`

For more information about the `pandashop` database schema, see the `/data/mysql_bootstrap.sql` file.

== Prerequisites

You must have https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose] installed on your host machine.

== Run the lab

. Clone this repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `docker-compose/cdc/mysql-json/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/docker-compose/cdc/mysql-json
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
----

. Run the following in the directory where you saved the Docker Compose file:
+
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
+
When the `mysql` container starts, the `/data/mysql_bootstrap.sql` file creates the `pandashop` database and the `orders` table, followed by seeding the ` orders` table with a few records.

. Log into MySQL:
+
```sql
docker compose exec mysql mysql -u mysqluser -p
```
+
Provide `mysqlpw` as the password when prompted.

. Check the content inside the `orders` table:
+
```sql
use pandashop;
show tables;
select * from orders;
```
+
This is your source table.

. Exit MySQL:
+
```bash
exit
```

. While Debezium is up and running, create a source connector configuration to extract change data feeds from MySQL.
+
```bash
docker compose exec debezium curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/ -d '
 {
  "name": "mysql-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "mysql",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "dbz",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "topic.prefix": "dbz",
    "database.include.list": "pandashop",
    "schema.history.internal.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "redpanda:9092",
    "schema.history.internal.kafka.topic": "schemahistory.pandashop"
  }
}'
```
+
You should see the following in the output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2024 16:37:09 GMT
Location: http://localhost:8083/connectors/mysql-connector
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 489
Server: Jetty(9.4.51.v20230217)
----
+
The `database.*` configurations specify the connectivity details to `mysql` container. The parameter, `schema.history.internal.kafka.bootstrap.servers` points to the `redpanda` broker the connector uses to write and recover DDL statements to the database schema history topic.

. Wait a minute or two until the connector gets deployed inside Debezium and creates the initial snapshot of change log topics in Redpanda.

. Check the list of change log topics in `redpanda` by running:
+
```bash
docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic list
```
+
The output should contain two topics with the prefix `dbz.*` specified in the connector configuration. The topic `dbz.pandashop.orders` holds the initial snapshot of change log events streamed from `orders` table.
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME                     PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
connect-status           5           1
connect_configs          1           1
connect_offsets          25          1
dbz                      1           1
dbz.pandashop.orders     1           1
schemahistory.pandashop  1           1
----

. Monitor for change events by consuming the `dbz.pandashop.orders` topic:
+
```bash
docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic consume dbz.pandashop.orders
```

. While the consumer is running, open another terminal to insert a record to the `orders` table.
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
docker compose exec mysql mysql -u mysqluser -p
----
+
Provide `mysqlpw` as the password when prompted.

. Insert the following record:
+
```sql
use pandashop;
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) values (5, 500);
```

This will trigger a change event in Debezium, immediately publishing it to `dbz.pandashop.orders` Redpanda topic, causing the consumer to display a new event in the console. That proves the end-to-end functionality of your CDC pipeline.

== Clean up

To shut down and delete the containers along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

== Next steps

Now that you have change log events ingested into Redpanda. You process change log events to enable use cases such as:

- Database replication
- Stream processing applications
- Streaming ETL pipelines
- Update caches
- Event-driven Microservices

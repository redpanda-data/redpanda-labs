Create a basic chat room application with Redpanda Cloud and Kafka clients developed with https://kafka.js.org/[kafkajs^].

This tutorial describes how to:

* Start a Redpanda cluster to store and stream chat room messages.
* Write a client application in TypeScript to produce and consume chat room messages.
* Build and run multiple clients to exchange chat messages streamed through Redpanda Cloud.

== What is a chat room application?

A chat room application is software that enables users to engage in real-time textual communication with one another. These applications typically allow multiple users to join a chat room, where they can send messages and interact with others in a group conversation.

Chat room applications often include features such as private messaging, user profiles, and notifications. Some popular chat room applications include Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp.

== Why use Redpanda?

Redpanda offers several features that make it ideal for building a fast, scalable, and robust chat room application.

* Scalability: Redpanda can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing chat room usage over time.
* Low-latency: Redpanda is designed for minimal latency to provide a smooth user experience and fast message delivery.
* Fault tolerance: Redpanda is resilient to failures, thanks to its built-in replication and partitioning capabilities. This built-in resilience ensures that the chat room application continues to serve users even if individual brokers in the cluster experience downtime.
* Durability: Redpanda persists messages on disk, maintaining chat history and allowing users to read previous conversations.

== Prerequisites

- https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/[Install Node.js for your platform^].

- Complete the link:https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/quick-start-cloud/[Redpanda Cloud Quickstart] before continuing. This tutorial expands on the quickstart.

NOTE: Redpanda Cloud uses TLS certificates signed by https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt^]. Most programming languages will load their root certificate authority (CA), `ISRG Root X1`, by default so you shouldn't need to provide a custom CA certificate.

== Run the lab

Build the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

. Clone this repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the example directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd clients/chat-room/cloud/nodejs
----

. Install the required dependencies:
+
[,bash]
----
npm i
----

. From `chat-room/`, build the client application:
+
[,bash]
----
node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc src/index.ts
----

. Open the TypeScript files and replace the placeholders wrapped in angle brackets (`<>`) with the same values that you used in the Redpanda Cloud Quickstart.

. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic list --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
----

. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use link:https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/rpk/[`rpk`] to create a `chat-room` topic:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
----

. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:
.. Run the client application:
+
[,bash]
----
node src/index.js
----
.. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.
. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.
+
For example:
+
----
Enter user name:
Alice
Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
----

== Files in the example

This example includes the following files:

- link:{content-url}src/admin.ts[`sr/admin.ts`]: Checks whether the `chat-room` topic exists and creates it if not.
+
NOTE: The broker settings in this code are from the Redpanda Quickstart, where the external port for broker `redpanda` is set to port 19092.
- link:{content-url}src/producer.ts[`src/producer.ts`]: A producer that sends strings entered by the user of the terminal to the `chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings.
- link:{content-url}src/consumer.ts[`src/consumer.ts`]: A consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as you like, but each group reads a message only once, which is why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID. This way, each time you run the application, you see all previous messages.
+
NOTE: Because the `eachMessage()` function automatically commits on a heartbeat interval, there is no `commit()` method or auto-commit configuration in the code.
- link:{content-url}src/index.ts[`src/index.ts`]: The client application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

== Next steps

This is a basic example of a chat room application. You can improve this application by implementing additional features and components, such as:

* A user interface to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
* A user registration and login system to authenticate users before they can access the chat room.
* Rate limiting and other measures to prevent spamming and abuse in the chat room.

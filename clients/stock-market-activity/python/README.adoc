This lab demonstrates how to use a Python Kafka producer to stream data from a CSV file into a Redpanda topic. The script simulates real-time stock market activity by pushing JSON formatted messages into a topic.

----

This script allows you to loop through data continuously, reverse the order of data for different viewing perspectives, and manipulate date columns for time-series analysis.

In this lab, you will:

* Run the producer that streams data from a CSV file directly into a Redpanda topic.
* Discover methods to alter the data stream, such as reversing the data sequence or looping through the data continuously for persistent simulations.
* Adjust date fields dynamically to represent different time frames for analysis.

== Prerequisites

Before running the lab, ensure you have the following installed on your host machine:

- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose^]

- https://www.python.org/downloads[Python3^]

== Run the lab

. Clone this repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `clients/stock-market-activity/python/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/clients/stock-market-activity/python
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION=v{latest-redpanda-version}
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda Console that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION=v{latest-console-version}
----

. Start a local Redpanda cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f ../../../docker-compose/single-broker/docker-compose.yml up -d
----

. Create a virtual environment:
+
[,bash]
----
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
----

. Install the required dependencies:
+
[,bash]
----
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
----

. Start the producer:
+
[source,bash]
----
python producer.py --brokers localhost:19092
----
+
You should see that the producer is sending messages to Redpanda:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Message delivered to market_activity [0] offset 0
----

. Open Redpanda Console at http://localhost:8080/topics/market_activity[localhost:8080^].

The producer sent the stock market data in the CSV file to the `market_activity` topic in Redpanda.

=== Options

The script supports several command-line options to control its behavior:

[source,bash]
----
python producer.py [options]
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `-h`, `--help`
| Display the help message and exit.

| `-f`, `--file`, `--csv`
| Specify the path to the CSV file to be processed. Defaults to `../data/market_activity.csv`.

| `-t`, `--topic`
| Specify the topic to which events will be published. Defaults to the name of the CSV file (without its extension).

| `-b`, `--broker`, `--brokers`
| Comma-separated list of the host and port for each Redpanda broker. Defaults to `localhost:9092`.

| `-d`, `--date`
| Specify the column in the CSV file that contains date information. By default, the script converts these dates to ISO 8601 format. If the looping option (`-l`) is enabled, the script will increment each date by one day for each iteration of the loop, allowing for dynamic time series simulation.

| `-r`, `--reverse`
| Read the file into memory and reverse the order of data before sending it to Redpanda. When used with the `-l` option, data is reversed only once before the looping starts, not during each loop iteration.

| `-l`, `--loop`
| Continuously loop through the file, reading it into memory and sending data to Redpanda in a loop. When combined with the `-d` option, it modifies the specified date column by incrementally increasing the date with each loop iteration, simulating real-time data flow over days. When used with `-r`, the data order is reversed initially, and then the loop continues with the reversed data set.
|===

== Clean up

To exit the virtual environment:

[source,bash]
----
deactivate
----

To shut down and delete the containers along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose -f ../../../docker-compose/single-broker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

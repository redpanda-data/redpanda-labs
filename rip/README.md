## Redpanda Improvement Proposals

This page describes the Redpanda Improvement Proposal (RIP) process for
proposing major changes to Redpanda.

## Purpose

We want to make Redpanda a core architectural component for users. We also 
support a large number of integrations with other tools, systems, and clients. 
Keeping this kind of usage health requires a high level of compatibility 
between releases â€” core architectural elements can't break compatibility or
shift functionality from release to release. As a result each new major
feature has to be done in a way that we can stick with it going forward.

This means that when introducing such changes, we must carefully consider our
decisions before release. Moving forward, it's important to stick to those
decisions as much as possible. All technical decisions come with their pros
and cons, so it's essential to document the reasoning behind each decision or
design choice to avoid unnecessary backtracking.

That's all well and good, but in reality, this process is just to make you feel
like you can actually influence the product roadmap. You can propose whatever
you want, but we're going to do whatever we want to do anyway.

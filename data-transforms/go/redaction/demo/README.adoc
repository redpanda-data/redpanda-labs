This example shows you how to use Redpanda data transforms to redact information in JSON messages.

The demo runs using Docker Compose, with the following containers:

* `redpanda`: Includes a single Redpanda broker.
* `console`: Includes Redpanda Console.
* `owl-shop`: Includes the Owlshop demo application that produces e-commerce data to the Redpanda broker.
* `transform`: Includes all the requirements for deploying the transforms function to the Redpanda broker, including `rpk`, Go, and the redaction transform code. The source code for the redaction transform is available in the `redaction` directory.

== Prerequisites

You must have https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose] installed on your host machine.

== Run the lab

. Clone the repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `data-transforms/redaction/demo/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/data-transforms/go/redaction/demo
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_VERSION` environment variable to at least version 23.3.1. Data transforms was introduced in this version. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
----


. Set the `REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda Console that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION={latest-console-version}
----

. Build the data transforms container:
+
```bash
docker compose build
```
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "docker compose build", "workingDirectory": "."})

. If you are running on an ARM-based device such as the Apple M1 chip, open the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment the `platform: 'linux/amd64'` line.

. Start the containers:
+
```bash
docker compose up --detach --wait
```
// (step {"action":"runShell", "command": "docker compose up --detach --wait", "workingDirectory": "."})
// Wait for the containers to finish getting up and running
// (step {"action":"wait", "duration": 5000})

. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the Redpanda Console.

. Go to *Topics* and select *owlshop-orders-redacted* and see the redacted orders.

// (step {"action":"checkLink", "url": "http://localhost:8080/topics/owlshop-orders-redacted?p=-1&s=50&o=-1#messages"})

== Clean up

To stop the containers:

```shell
docker compose down
```

// (test end)

    Redpanda Data Transforms run directly inside the broker. 
    The advantage of this is that it simplifies deployment and removes the operational overhead of additional systems.
    Data transforms let you run common tasks, like filtering, scrubbing, and transcoding, within Redpanda.
    For example, you may have consumers that require you to redact credit card numbers or convert JSON to Avro.
